<!-- About page content -->
Hi, I'm Adarsh Kumar, { age } years old, and a College Student at [SCU](https://scu.edu).  
I am a web developer, programmer, tech enthusiast, photographer, and history enthusiast.  
I created this site to share my journey, showcase my projects, and other things alike.  
Explore my work, learn from my mistakes, and join me as I explore technology and photography.  
I am good with software, so if you need tech help, let me know! I also enjoy history and geography.
