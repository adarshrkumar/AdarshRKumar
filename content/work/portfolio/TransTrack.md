I designed and tested a public transportation app for my Innovation Diploma class. I gathered feedback through surveys and interviews with a diverse group of users. I iterated on the prototype, adding route planning and real-time tracking. The aim was to improve UI, usability, and accessibility so that more people would use public transport.
