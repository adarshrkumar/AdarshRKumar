I was browsing through some old [repls](https://repl.it) that I have and found some interesting templates that you might want to use as a starter.  
And yes, you can use them as is.

## For Websistes

### Node.JS

I found [this](https://is.gd/NodeTemplate) Node.JS template that I made that you can use to create your website using HTML, CSS, and JS with the added help of server-side Node.JS.  
I just some time ago, updated this template a bit to make it mode modern looking as well as condense the css.  

**Fun Fact:** This almost used to be my exact website, but with my content on it.

### HTML

I found [this](https://is.gd/HTMLTemplate) HTML template that I made that you can use to create your website using HTML, CSS, and JS.  
This template renders the same as the Node.JS template, except for the recent changes.

**Fun Fact:** *This* used to be my exact website, but with my content on it.

## For CSS Features

### Flexbox Template

I found [this](https://is.gd/FlexTemplate) HTML template that I made that you can use to practice your flexbox skills.

### Grid Layout Template

I found [this](https://is.gd/GridTemplate) HTML template that I made that you can use to practice your CSS grid skills.

## For App Mockups

I found [this](https://is.gd/AppTemplate) HTML template that I made that you can use to code app mockups that are displayed inside of a mockup phone.
